### Let's Interact with Your Prototype

You can now talk to your Pi by simply saying the wake word "Alexa". Try the following -

* Say "Alexa", then wait for the beep. Now say "What time is it?"  
* Say "Alexa", then wait for the beep. Now say "What's the weather in Las Vegas?"  
* Say "Alexa", then wait for the beep. Now say "Set a timer for 5 seconds."
* Say "Alexa", then wait for the beep. Now say "Play KEXP."
* Say "Alexa", then wait for the beep. Now say "What's my Flash Briefing?"
* Say "Alexa", then wait for the beep. Now say "What are the deals of the day?"
* Say "Alexa", then wait for the beep. Now say "Tell me a joke?"

Now let's enable some skills. Open the Amazon Alexa app on your phone or head over to https://alexa.amazon.com. Click **Skills**. Poke around, find something you like and follow the instructions. Make sure to enable more than one.

If you prefer, you can also click on the **Listen** button, instead of using the wake word. Click the **Listen** button and wait for the audio cue before beginning to speak. It may take a second or two before you hear the audio cue.
