### Run Your Node.js Server, Sample App and Wake Word Engine

Now that installation is complete, you'll need to run three commands in **3 separate terminal windows**:

1. **Terminal Window 1**: to run the web service for authorization
2. **Terminal Window 2**: to run the sample app to communicate with AVS
3. **Terminal Window 3**: to run the wake word engine which allows you to start an interaction using the phrase "Alexa".

**Note:** These commands must be run in order.

---

#### Terminal Window 1
Open a new terminal window and type the following commands to bring up the web service which is used to authorize your sample app with AVS:

	cd ~/Desktop/alexa-avs-sample-app/samples/companionService && npm start

The server is now running on port 3000 and you are ready to start the client.		

See [API Overview > Authorization](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service/content/avs-api-overview#authorization) to learn more about authorization.

#### Terminal Window 2

Open a new terminal window and type the following commands to run the sample app, which communicates with AVS:

	cd ~/Desktop/alexa-avs-sample-app/samples/javaclient && mvn exec:exec

See [API Overview > Interfaces](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service/content/avs-api-overview#interfaces) to learn more about the messages sent to/from AVS.

Let's walk through the next few steps relevant to Window 2.

1. When you run the client, a window should pop up with a message that says -

	 *Please register your device by visiting the following URL in a web browser and following the instructions: https://localhost:3000/provision/d340f629bd685deeff28a917. Would you like to open the URL automatically in your default browser?*

	 Click on **"Yes"** to open the URL in your default browser.

2. If you're running Raspbian Jessie with Pixel desktop (and with Chromium browser), you may get a warning from the browser. You can get around it by clicking on **Advanced -> Proceed to localhost(unsafe)**.

3. You'll be taken to a Login with Amazon web page. Enter your Amazon credentials.

4. You'll be taken to a Dev Authorization page, confirming that youâ€™d like your device to access the Security Profile created earlier.

	 Click **Okay**.

5. You will now be redirected to a URL beginning with `https://localhost:3000/authresponse` followed by a query string. The body of the web page will say device tokens ready.

6. Return to the Java application and click the OK button. The client is now ready to accept Alexa requests.

#### Terminal Window 3

This project supports two third-party wake word engines: Sensory's TrulyHandsFree and KITT.AI's Snowboy. The **-e** parameter is used to select the agent and supports two values for engine: **kitt_ai** and **sensory**.

Open a new terminal window and use the following commands to bring up a wake word engine from Sensory or KITT.AI. The wake word engine will allow you to initiate interactions using the phrase "Alexa".

To use the **Sensory** wake word engine, type -

	cd ~/Desktop/alexa-avs-sample-app/samples
	cd wakeWordAgent/src && ./wakeWordAgent -e sensory

or type this to use **KITT.AI**'s wake word engine -

	cd ~/Desktop/alexa-avs-sample-app/samples
	cd wakeWordAgent/src && ./wakeWordAgent -e kitt_ai

Now you have a working hands-free AVS prototype!
